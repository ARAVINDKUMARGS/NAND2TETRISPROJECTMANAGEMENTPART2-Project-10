## Project 10 – Advanced Operating System (OS II)

**Project Code:** PROJECT10
**Course:** Build a Modern Computer from First Principles (Nand2Tetris Part II)
**Institution:** Hebrew University of Jerusalem

---

## Overview

Project 10 extends Project 9 by implementing **advanced operating system routines**. This includes **exception handling, system calls, and enhanced I/O functionality**. The project enables **user-level programs** to interact with the OS, providing a complete runtime environment for Jack programs compiled into VM code.

---

## Objectives

* Extend OS routines from Project 9 to handle **exceptions** and edge cases.
* Implement **full-screen I/O** routines for output and user interaction.
* Provide **system-level functions** for memory, stack, and I/O operations.
* Ensure compatibility with **VM code generated from Project 8**.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Load OS Library

Ensure the `Sys.vm` library is present in your program directory. This contains all advanced OS routines.

### Step 2: Run Test Programs

1. Open the **VM Emulator**.
2. Load `ScreenTest.vm` to verify screen output routines.
3. Load `KeyboardTest.vm` to verify keyboard input.
4. Run `ExceptionTest.vm` to ensure exception handling works correctly.

### Step 3: Verify Output

* Screen and keyboard routines should function as expected.
* Exceptions (like invalid memory access) should be handled gracefully.

---

## Supported Features

### Memory & Stack

* All Project 9 memory segments and operations remain supported.
* Additional routines for safe access and error detection.

### Screen & Keyboard

* Full-screen output routines with cursor control.
* Keyboard input routines with blocking and non-blocking options.

### Exception Handling

* Detect and handle invalid memory access or arithmetic errors.
* Provide safe termination or error messages for programs.

### Example

**Keyboard Test (`KeyboardTest.vm`):**

```vm
label START
while Keyboard.keyPressed
   push Keyboard.key
   call Output.printChar 1
end
```

Expected behavior: prints keys pressed on the screen.

---

## Notes

* OS II routines are **required for user programs that interact with the system**.
* Proper testing ensures programs generated by Project 8 can run without errors.
* This project bridges the gap between compiler-generated VM code and real program execution.
